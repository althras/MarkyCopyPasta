# MarkyCopyPasta
While this script is running, a green 'H' icon will be in your system tray. This program copies a vertical column of marks from Excel into the coursework marks entry page in CaMSys.

How to use:
1. Open the Excel file containing your marks and place the Excel cell cursor at the top of the column of marks (on the first student's mark) you wish to copy. Make sure there is nothing in the cell below the last mark. Any students with no marks should be given a zero. For Exam Marks Entry, copy the special grades (W, R) from CaMSys marks entry page into the cell for the student's mark.
2. Open Chrome, log into CaMSys and navigate to the Coursework Marks Entry page for your subject. Click on the component required, and place your cursor inside the box for the first student's mark.
3. Press Ctrl+[ for CW Marks Entry or Ctrl+] for CW Sub Component Marks Entry Page or Ctrl+/ for Exam Marks Entry Page. Do not touch the keyboard while the script runs.
Repeat this with as many columns of marks as you need, selecting the correct start of columns in Excel and CaMSys respectively.

This program can also check if the order of Student IDs in Excel and CaMSys matches:
1. Open the Excel file containing your marks and place the Excel cell cursor at the top of the column of Student IDs (on the first student's ID).
2. Open Chrome, log into CaMSys and navigate to the Coursework Marks Entry page for your subject. Make sure the cursor is not in the input box. (If you just opened the page, you don't have to do anything. Or you can click randomly somewhere on the text in the page.)
3. Press Ctrl+; (semi-colon). Do not touch the keyboard while the script runs.

Press Alt+Q to Quit the script, or right-click the 'H' icon in your system tray and click Exit.

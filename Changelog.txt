v1.6 - "I" grades will now be entered in the Final Exam Marks Entry
       page instead of being skipped to match the page behavior.

26 July 2024
v1.5 - Added function to check entered totals for Coursework Marks
       Entry page.
     - Added error detection when automatically entering marks to
       prevent script going haywire.

18 July 2024
v1.4 - Use slower marks entry behavior for
       Final Marks Entry (OBE /w Breakup) page.
     - Added shortcut key description to quit button.

28 June 2024
v1.3 - Changed marks entry behavior to be slower. Workarounds with
       marks returning to zero are no longer required - should work consistently now regardless of how many zeroes there are that
       you are entering into the system.
     - Since this behavior is slower, it the script does an error
       mid-way and ends up tabbing around and pressing space in the
       wrong places, hit the shortcut key Alt+q to immediately quit
       the program and stop whatever it is doing.
     - Added a video in folder to show users the new behavior.
     - Now supports the new Student ID format

28 June 2024
v1.2 - Added instruction for workaround after CaMSys to CLIC change
       for user to press Tab key through entered marks before saving
       to avoid it returning to zero.

5 February 2024
v1.1 - Added GUI for ease of use.

11 October 2023
v1.0 - Bug fixes for Exam Marks Entry (w/ Breakup) pages with more
       than two columns/components of marks to enter. Instructions on
       how to use script when entering into this page updated.

12 July 2023
v0.3.1 - Now supports OBE Marks Entry(w/Breakup) pages in CaMSys.

6 July 2023
v0.3 - Combined keys for CW Marks and Exam Marks entry. Sub Component
       still separate key since can't reliably detect page name (page
       changes browser title if entered from
       Instructor Workcenter->CW Marks Entry, but doesn't change
       browser title if entered directly from Main Menu->CW Marks
       Entry, which most ppl will come from). Added Alt-H for help to
       pop-up the help screen. Added a Help/Instructions to the
       tray's icon's right-click menu.
     - Slowed down the script a bit so it doesn't accidentally fail
       to copy from Excel, or copy text from CaMSys text. Slightly
       more reliable.
     - Confirmed that Exam Marks Entry page for large number of
       students will fail first attempt at copying for unknown
       reasons. If you don't refresh the page however, and try again,
       it will work correctly without problems. Improved the message
       to alert the user to try again.

5 July 2023

         pages.
